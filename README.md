# Modified-LL
Linked list which has many modifications
Personally preffered the Linus Trovaldos Approach(Mind the spelling).
## Goal of the Repo.
* This repositry can be used in as a template for competitive coders.
* And many numerous problems which use DSA and may need a linked list.
* The use of this repositry can be done while creating kernel process.
* For any new OS maker.

## Hash Table
* Works on Strings
* This code I created 3 years ago
* This hash table is based on collision controllers
* If collision occurs it adds to the next element in linked list
* So both deletion and search are adjusted accordingly
* It use strings(character array) by hashing them by thier int conversions
* We can expand the hash table by changing the ``HashTableSize`` in the code

## Linked List Menu
* This code is for Linked List, which has well laid out menu of the terms.
* A code I wrote way back to Test my skills
